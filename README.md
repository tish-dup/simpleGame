Just a simple game

This game was build by using pygame. 

It's a simple came where the players needs to move through 'enemies' to get to a 'prize'. The enemies are randomly generated and move in the oposite direction of the player. Once the player 'crashes' into an enemy the game is over and the player lost. If the player manages to get through the enemies and all the enemies are off the screen then the player has won. 

This is just for fun for anyone who wants to try a simple and easy game. 

The author of the program maintains the program and is the sole contributor. 

The user can run this code on any IDE and it will display pictures of the player and the enemies. The player can move up, down, left and right with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
